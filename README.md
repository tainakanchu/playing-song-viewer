# playing-song-viewer
This is a Next.js application that retrieves some information of the currently playing song from the Icecast server and displays it.
It is mainly intended for use with Traktor Pro.

## Features
- Via the Icecast server, information about the song currently playing on Traktor DJ can be displayed in the browser.
- The artwork of the currently playing song can be displayed.
  - This feature uses metadata embedded in the music data, so it is only available for files where such data exists.
  - It is assumed that iTunes has automatically sorted the songs into directories; otherwise, different song artwork may be displayed or files may not be found.

## Preparation
### Install applications
Download the installer appropriate for your OS from [Download â€” Icecast](https://icecast.org/download/) and install it.

To build and run this project, you need to have installed Node.js, and pnpm.

Of course, in order to receive streams from Traktor DJ, you also need to install Traktor DJ :)
